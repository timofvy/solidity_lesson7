# Crypton.studio Hardhat Starter Kit

Implementation of the "HelloWorldContract" using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment.

# Getting Started

It's recommended that you've gone through the [hardhat getting started documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) before proceeding here.

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
        -   `node --version`and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
-   [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` And get an output like: `x.x.x`
        -   You might need to install it with npm

> If you're familiar with `npx` and `npm` instead of `yarn`, you can use `npx` for execution and `npm` for installing dependencies.

## Quickstart

1. Clone and install dependencies

After installing all the requirements, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CryptonFactory/hh-starter-kit
cd hardhat-starter-kit
```

Then:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm i
```

2. You can now do stuff!

```
yarn hardhat test
```

or

```
yarn hardhat test
```

# Usage

If you run `yarn hardhat --help` you'll get an output of all the tasks you can run.

## Deploying Contracts

```
yarn hardhat deploy
```

This will deploy your contracts to a local network. If you'd like to interact with your deployed contracts, skip down to [Interacting with Deployed Contracts](#interacting-with-deployed-contracts).

## Run a Local Network

One of the best ways to test and interact with smart contracts is with a local network. To run a local network with all your contracts in it, run the following:

```
yarn hardhat node
```

You'll get a local blockchain, private keys, contracts deployed (from the `deploy` folder scripts), and an endpoint to potentially add to an EVM wallet.

## Using a Testnet or Live Network (like Mainnet or Polygon)

In your `hardhat.config.ts` you'll see section like:

```typescript
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
```

This section of the file is where you define which networks you want to interact with. You can read more about that whole file in the [hardhat documentation.](https://hardhat.org/config/)

To interact with a live or test network, you'll need:

1. An rpc URL
2. A Private Key
3. ETH

Let's look at an example of setting these up using the Sepolia testnet.

### Sepolia Ethereum Testnet Setup

First, we will need to set environment variables. We can do so by setting them in our `.env` file (create it if it's not there). You can also read more about [environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html) from the linked twilio blog. You'll find a sample of what this file will look like in `.env.example`

> IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE YOU'D DONT EXPOSE THE KEYS YOU PUT IN THIS `.env` FILE. By that, I mean don't push them to a public repo, and please try to keep them keys you use in development not associated with any real funds.

1. Set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` [environment variable.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

You can get one for free from [Alchmey](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://infura.io/), or [Moralis](https://moralis.io/speedy-nodes/). This is your connection to the blockchain.

2. Set your `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

This is your private key from your wallet, ie [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). This is needed for deploying contracts to public networks. You can optionally set your `MNEMONIC` environment variable instead with some changes to the `hardhat.config.ts`.

![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) **WARNING** ![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)

When developing, it's best practice to use a Metamask that isn't associated with any real money. A good way to do this is to make a new browser profile (on Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc) and install Metamask on that brower, and never send this wallet money.

Don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!

`.env` example:

```
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL='https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/asdfadsfafdadf'
PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

`bash` example

```
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL='https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/asdfadsfafdadf'
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

> You can also use a `MNEMONIC` instead of a `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable by uncommenting the section in the `hardhat.config.ts`, and commenting out the `PRIVATE_KEY` line. However this is not recommended.

For other networks like mainnet and polygon, you can use different environment variables for your RPC URL and your private key. See the `hardhat.config.ts` to learn more.

3. Get some Sepolia Testnet ETH and LINK

Head over to the [Chainlink faucets](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some ETH. Please follow [the chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/acquire-link/) if unfamiliar.

5. Running commands

You should now be all setup! You can run any command and just pass the `--network sepolia` now!

To deploy contracts:

```
yarn hardhat deploy --network sepolia
```

## Forking

If you'd like to run tests or on a network that is a [forked network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/guides/mainnet-forking.html)

1. Set a `MAINNET_RPC_URL` environment variable that connects to the mainnet.
2. Choose a block number to select a state of the network you are forking and set it as `FORKING_BLOCK_NUMBER` environment variable. If ignored, it will use the latest block each time which can lead to test inconsistency.
3. Set `enabled` flag to `true`/`false` to enable/disable forking feature

```
      forking: {
        url: MAINNET_RPC_URL,
        blockNumber: FORKING_BLOCK_NUMBER,
        enabled: false,
      }
```

# Test

Tests are located in the [test](./test/) directory.

To run unit tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

or

```
yarn hardhat test
```

## Performance optimizations

Since all tests are written in a way to be independent from each other, you can save time by running them in parallel. Make sure that `AUTO_FUND=false` inside `.env` file. There are some limitations with parallel testing, read more about them [here](https://hardhat.org/guides/parallel-tests.html)

To run tests in parallel:

```
yarn test --parallel
```

or

```
yarn hardhat test --parallel
```

or

```
yarn hardhat test
```

You can make Hardhat run faster by preventing ts-node from recompiling and type-checking your project on every run by setting the `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` env variable to 1:

```
TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=1 yarn test
```

# Interacting with Deployed Contracts

After deploying your contracts, the deployment output will give you the contract addresses as they are deployed. You can then use these contract addresses in conjunction with Hardhat tasks to perform operations on each contract.

## Verify on Etherscan

You'll need an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one from the [Etherscan API site.](https://etherscan.io/apis). If you have it set, your deploy script will try to verify them by default, but if you want to verify any manually, you can run: . If you have it set, your deploy script will try to verify them by default, but if you want to verify any manually, you can run:

```
yarn hardhat verify --network <NETWORK> <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETERS>
```

example:

```
yarn hardhat verify --network sepolia 0x9279791897f112a41FfDa267ff7DbBC46b96c296 "0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331"
```

# View Contracts Size

```
yarn run hardhat size-contracts
```

# Linting

This will [lint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) your smart contracts.

```
yarn lint:fix
```

# Code Formating

This will format both your typescript and solidity to look nicer.

```
yarn format
```

# Estimaging Gas

To estimate gas, just set a `REPORT_GAS` environment variable to true, and then run:

```
yarn hardhat test
```

If you'd like to see the gas prices in USD or other currency, add a `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` from [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/).

# Code coverage

To see a measure in percent of the degree to which the smart contract source code is executed when a particular test suite is run, type

```
yarn coverage
```
